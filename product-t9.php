                                            Trace9 4.0 offers different licensing options for B2C and B2B customers. B2C
                                            customers can choose between perpetual and subscription licenses. Perpetual
                                            licenses allow customers to pay a one-time fee and own the software forever.
                                            Subscription licenses allow customers to pay a recurring annual fee and
                                            access the software for a limited period of time. B2B customers can only
                                            choose subscription licenses, but they have the option to select from
                                            different bundles: silver, gold, or platinum. Each bundle includes a set of
                                            modules and features that suit different service levels and customer
                                            segments. Trace9 4.0 licensing options are designed to provide flexibility
                                            and affordability for customers and service providers. For service
                                            providers, Trace9 software includes a demo bundle that allows them to try
                                            out the software before choosing other bundles.
