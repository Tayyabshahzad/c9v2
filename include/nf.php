                                NFV monitoring in Trace9 4.0 involves monitoring the virtualized network functions in the same way as physical network functions, but with additional focus on the virtualization layer. This includes monitoring the resource usage of the virtualized infrastructure, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network I/O. It also involves monitoring the performance of the virtualized network functions themselves, such as network throughput, packet loss, and latency.  
                                </p>

                                To monitor NFV in Trace9 4.0, the monitoring solution needs to be able to access the virtualized network functions and the underlying infrastructure. This can be achieved through APIs provided by the virtualization platform, such as OpenStack's Ceilometer API, or by deploying agents within the virtual machines that run the virtualized network functions.
