                Amygdala XDR's rootkit detection module provides a way to detect and respond to rootkits, which are stealthy malware that can hide their presence on a compromised system. The module is designed to identify any unauthorized changes to the system that might indicate the presence of a rootkit. Amygdala XDRâ€™s rootkit detection module uses a variety of techniques to detect rootkits, including file integrity monitoring, process monitoring, and kernel module monitoring. It can detect changes to critical system files, the creation of new processes, and the loading of unauthorized kernel modules. 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                In addition to detecting rootkits, Amygdala XDR's rootkit detection module can also take actions to respond to rootkits, such as alerting security teams, blocking network traffic, or quarantining affected systems. The module is highly customizable and can be tailored to the specific needs of an organization. It can be configured to monitor specific files, directories, and processes, and to trigger alerts based on specific events or thresholds.

                <p>
                Amygdala XDR's rootkit detection module uses a combination of techniques to detect and respond to rootkits, which are stealthy malware that can hide their presence on a compromised system. The module includes file integrity monitoring, which detects changes to critical system files that may be indicative of a rootkit. It also includes process monitoring, which detects the creation of new processes that may be associated with a rootkit. Additionally, kernel module monitoring is included to detect the loading of unauthorized kernel modules that may be associated with a rootkit. 
                <br/>
                Amygdala XDR's rootkit detection module leverages your system-level APIs and kernel modules to monitor system activity and detect signs of a rootkit. It uses the Open-Source Security Information Management (OSSIM) framework for event correlation and analysis, allowing it to generate alerts and notifications based on specific criteria.
